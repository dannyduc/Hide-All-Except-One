## hide all except one

### Overview

This works like tabs, however you may
style it however you want of course.

The tabs are bookmarkable, however browser
back and forward buttons (history) does not
work.

### How To

Create links as such and place them 
anywhere in your markup:

   <a href="#lorem" class="tab">lorem</a>
   <a href="#ipsum" class="tab">ipsum</a>

Create your 'tab' content:

   <div id="lorem" class="box">
     lorem
   </div>
   <div id="ipsum" class="box">
     ipsum
   </div>

Then call the javascript as such:

  <script>
    jQuery(function($){
      $.hideAllExcept('.tab', '.box');
    });
  </script>

### No Javascript

In the case where javascript is not enabled
the browser will scroll to the target.

### Requirements
